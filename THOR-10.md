# Happy first decade!

The internet congratulates you on completing your first **decade**!

We know you don't care for presents, so just this message should be more than engouth, right?

## WRONG!

So you do want a present?  Well then, in that case, you must find it!

Here's a bit of help:

> This house has a big porch  
but that is not where it is  
how about the family room?  
no it is not there either :)  
oh the basement, the basement,  
now you're getting warmer...  
this house has two refrigerators  
one upstairs  
one downstairs  
check next to the downstairs one  
there is a big box there  

### GO!
